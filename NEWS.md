# BayesPostEst 0.1.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Improved `mcmcRocPrc()` speed by replacing imported ROCR functions with faster custom ROC and PR curve calculators. The test example with "fullsims = TRUE" should now take 2s or less to run instead of the previous 10-30s. (#25)
* Removed ROCR package from dependencies. 
* Changed the `mcmcRocPrc()` interface. Instead of pre-calculating several data matrices, the function now takes a fitted "rjags" object ([R2jags::jags()]) as input along with names of the dependent and independent variables that were used in the model. 

# BayesPostEst 0.0.1

* Initial CRAN release.
