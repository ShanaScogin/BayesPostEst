\title{First Differences of a Bayesian Logit or Probit model}
\usage{
mcmcFD(
  modelmatrix,
  mcmcout,
  link = "logit",
  ci = c(0.025, 0.975),
  percentiles = c(0.25, 0.75),
  fullsims = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{modelmatrix}{model matrix, including intercept (if the intercept is among the
parameters estimated in the model). Create with model.matrix(formula, data).
Note: the order of columns in the model matrix must correspond to the order of columns 
in the matrix of posterior draws in the \code{mcmcout} argument. See the \code{mcmcout}
argument for more.}

\item{mcmcout}{posterior distributions of all logit coefficients, 
in matrix form. This can be created from rstan, MCMCpack, R2jags, etc. and transformed
into a matrix using the function as.mcmc() from the coda package for \code{jags} class
objects, as.matrix() from base R for \code{mcmc}, \code{mcmc.list}, \code{stanreg}, and 
\code{stanfit} class objects, and \code{object$sims.matrix} for \code{bugs} class objects.
Note: the order of columns in this matrix must correspond to the order of columns 
in the model matrix. One can do this by examining the posterior distribution matrix and sorting the 
variables in the order of this matrix when creating the model matrix. A useful function for sorting 
column names containing both characters and numbers as 
you create the matrix of posterior distributions is \code{mixedsort()} from the gtools package.}

\item{link}{type of generalized linear model; a character vector set to \code{"logit"} (default) 
or \code{"probit"}.}

\item{ci}{the bounds of the credible interval. Default is \code{c(0.025, 0.975)} for the 95\% 
credible interval.}

\item{percentiles}{values of each predictor for which the difference in Pr(y = 1) 
is to be calculated. Default is \code{c(0.25, 0.75)}, which will calculate the difference 
between Pr(y = 1) for the 25th percentile and 75th percentile of the predictor. For binary 
predictors, the function automatically calculates the difference between Pr(y = 1) 
for x = 0 and x = 1.}

\item{fullsims}{logical indicator of whether full object (based on all MCMC draws 
rather than their average) will be returned. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{mcmcFD}. If \code{fullsims = FALSE} (default),
a data frame with five columns:
\itemize{
\item median_fd: median first difference
\item lower_fd: lower bound of credible interval of the first difference
\item upper_fd: upper bound of credible interval of the first difference
\item VarName: name of the variable as found in \code{modelmatrix}
\item VarID: identifier of the variable, based on the order of columns in
\code{modelmatrix} and  \code{mcmcout}. Can be adjusted for plotting
}
If \code{fullsims = TRUE}, a matrix with as many columns as predictors in the model. Each row 
is the first difference for that variable based on one set of posterior draws. Column names are taken 
from the column names of \code{modelmatrix}.
}
\description{
R function to calculate first differences after a Bayesian logit or probit model.
First differences are a method to summarize effects across covariates. This quantity represents
the difference in predicted probabilities for each covariate for cases with low and high values 
of the respective covariate. For each of these differences, all other variables are held constant 
at their median. For more, see Long (1997, Sage Publications) and King, Tomz, and Wittenberg (2000, 
American Journal of Political Science 44(2): 347-361).
