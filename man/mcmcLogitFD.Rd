\title{First Differences of a Bayesian}
\usage{
mcmcLogitFD(model_matrix, mcmc_out, ci = c(0.05, 0.95),
  percentiles = c(0.25, 0.75), full_sims = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_matrix}{model matrix, including intercept. Create with model.matrix(formula, data)}

\item{mcmc_out}{posterior distributions of all logit coefficients, 
in matrix form - can easily be created from rstan, MCMCpack, R2jags, etc.}

\item{ci}{the bounds of the credible interval}

\item{percentiles}{tbd}

\item{full_sims}{tbd}
